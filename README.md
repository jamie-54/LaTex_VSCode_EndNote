* [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). Follow the guidelines on how to insall Tex Live for your Preferred Platform.
[Click Here](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install#requirements) for further information and other optional software.

#### Configure

After installing LaTeX workshop Requires some configuration. To do this: 
* Open the VS Code Command (`Shift` + `Ctrl` + `P` Windows) or (`Shift` + `Cmd` + `P` macOS) or (F1)

<sup>If your `settings.json` already has code in it add a `,` to the end of the last line before `}` and copy the new code after the `,` and before `}`</sup>

LaTeX Workshop is now ready to use in VS Code

### EndNote with LaTeX
To use EndNote with LaTeX, the EndNote library can be exported as BibTeX. First EndNote has to be configured to do this:
* Open your EndNote Library and click `Tools`
* Click `Output Styles`
* Click `Open Style Manager`
* Scroll and tick the box `BibTeX Export`

Export EndNote as BibTeX. To do this:
* Click `File`
* Click `Export`
* File name: `YOUR_FILE_NAME.bib`
* Save as type: `Text File (*.txt)`
* Output style: `BibTeX Export`
* Untick `Export Selcted References`

<sup>Note: if you only want to export the references you had selected before starting to export, tick `Export Selcted References` </sup>

## Using EndNote with LaTeX
### Setting up Bibliography
When using LaTeX you should Keep all the relevent files in one folder. e.g `LaTeX_Template`

Inside this folder you should add the `YOUR_FILE_NAME.bib` (created in previous section) e.g `Example_EndNote_To_BibTeX.bib` [^1]

[^1]: You can directly export `YOUR_FILE_NAME.bib` to this folder

Inside this folder you can create your main LaTeX flie e.g `Latex_template.tex`

This is the only two files you need to create to reference using EndNote, the rest will be created automaticly when you build the LaTeX project.

### Adding Bibliography
At the bottom of the `Latex_template.tex` is the `\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}` this is the reference style you want to use. Below this is the `\bibliography{Example_EndNote_To_BibTeX}` the part inside `{}` should match the name of the exported EndNote .bib file e.g `Example_EndNote_To_BibTeX`

When you build your LaTeX project, the biblography will be atuomaticaly generted at the bottom of your LaTeX file only using the correct refrence used from `YOUR_FILE_NAME.bib` will be used therefore it does not matter if you export all your EndNote References.

### Adding references
When you add a new reference to EndNote it atuomaticaly assigns it a number `#NO` (seen at the top of the refernce when clicked in EndNote)

When using Output style: `BibTeX Export` on EndNote it assing `RN` followed by the number above as the Unique Reference Key eg `RN1` `RN54`

This means when you `\cite{}` the reference in you LaTeX file you use `#NO` from EndNote that you are referencing e.g `\cite{RN1}`

<sup>Note: You can manually  change the Unique Reference Key in VS Code if you want but personally I would not recommend this. If you update your EndNote library and want to export it again you will have to redo these changes</sup>

## LaTeX and Git
Since you are now using VS Code to edit your LaTeX files it is easy use Git to keep your files save.

```
git init
git add your_files_here
git commit -m "The commit message"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo
git push origin main
```

for more advice see [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

## Optional VS Code Extensions 
* [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

### Spell Checker set up 
On VS Code, install [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension. To do this: 
* Click `Extensions` on the primary side bar (Ctrl+Shift+X) or (F1)
* Search `Spell`
* Click `Code Spell Checker`
* Click `Install`

#### Configure

After installing, Code Spell Checker requires the correct languge configuration. To do this: 
* Open the VS Code Command (`Shift` + `Ctrl` + `P` Windows) or (`Shift` + `Cmd` + `P` macOS) or (F1)
* Search `Open User Settings JSON`
* Click on the file
* Now copy and paste the following inside the brackets {} of your `settings.json` file)

```
"cSpell.language": "en-GB"
```

<sup>If your `settings.json` already has code in it add a `,` to the end of the last line before `}` and copy the new code after the `,` and before `}`</sup>

## disclaimer
I am not an expert in VS Code, LaTeX or EndNote. I am just a PhD student trying to make it easier for students to refrence using LaTeX.
